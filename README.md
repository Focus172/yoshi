This is just a little thing i am messing around with to learn shell scripts. I currently plan to work on a less intensive way to render things. In the future, there may be real animations and reading from files.

If you are unsatisfied, I don't care.

# Instalation

Its a shell script. Put it in your /bin and make sure there are no name conflicts
